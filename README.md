You give some and you take some, just as simple as it is. And it helps, I started with the same and currently, I am a maintainer of:

- __go-freeGeoIP__: A Golang client for Free IP Geolocation API with inbuilt cache support to overcome the 15k per hour rate limit. [:link:](https://github.com/Shivam010/go-freeGeoIP)
- __bypass-cors__: A proxy server to bypass CORS enabled server APIs. [:link:](https://github.com/Shivam010/bypass-cors)

And also, a contributor to many open-source projects, some of them are:
- __nitishm/vegeta-server__: A RESTful API server for vegeta, a load testing tool written in Go. [:link:](https://github.com/nitishm/vegeta-server)
- __lib/pq__: A Pure Go Postgres driver for database/sql. [:link:](https://github.com/lib/pq)

I am, also active on Gophers [Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/), learning and helping users solve their problems whenever I can. 

I also work as a freelancer and ghost worker, helping individuals and organisations achieve their goals. Got something to discuss, 
any project idea, any other help you need? or maybe wanna just say ___Hello! ðŸ‘‹___
